# Odin Project - JS - Battle Ships Project:

## Project Description:
This project is part of the Odin Project's curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a simple game of battleships that can be played in the browser. The game will be played against the computer. 

The purpose of this project is to introduce TDD (Test Driven Development) and to continue to practice using modules in JS. 

## What I learned from this project:
- TTD
- Using modules in JS
- Using Jest to test JS code
- Using npm to install Jest

I feel like I was very successful with my first interaction with jest. I was able to write tests for all of my functions and then write the functions to pass the tests. I was also able to use the tests to help me debug my code. Overall I felt very comfortable using jest as a test environment.

## Things I could improve:
- While I feel I have a good understanding of TDD and was able to implement it well to build the backbone of this project. I did not use it for the development of the front-end. Having said this, the assignment did mention that we have not yet discussed testing the appearance of a webpage and therefore it was not required within the scope of this project. 

- I didn't put 100% of my effort into this project. Although I spent three days building this, there are some non-essential features that I feel I could have built into this project. For example, I could have added a feature that allows the user to choose the size of the board. I could have also added a feature that allows the user to choose the number of ships on the board.
